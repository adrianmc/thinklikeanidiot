First, we're going to teach you how to look cool.

It's very simple, we're going to be using [Google Chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome/) since it has all the tools we need and is relatively consistent across all platforms. So if you don't have it already downloaded and opened, let's get that set up now, I'll wait.

Got it?

Great, now let's show you something cool.

### How to Look Cool

You know that feeling you get when you show your friends something new that you learned? Especially if it's something that they don't know how to do. Even if it's just the smallest thing, you feel pretty darned good about yourself.

Let's get that feeling.

1) Right-click this icon:

<i class="fa fa-lightbulb-o fa-3x centered block"></i>

2) And select "Inspect Element".

3) You should be able to see something like this:

Congratulations, you will now appear cool to 90% of people who use Google Chrome.

Too easy? No worries, if you already knew this you can skip on ahead.

## So what is it?

That's called the developer's console. And it'll allow you to examine the elements that make up a webpage. We'll get into more detail later on, but if you look carefully you'll see that there is a highlighted line in what just popped up.

It reads something like this:

```html
<i class="fa fa-lightbulb-o fa-3x centered block"></i>
```

That's actually an HTML element. And webpages are basically built from these elements.
