  Brace yourselves, this might be a little long. I'll be explaining how other people are too smart, and how I'm too dumb and how that somehow qualifies me to write this blog about learning to program.
</p>

It all began when I was brought in to teach a coding bootcamp. This was a class full of beginners who would sit in a room from morning till night, 5 days a week, 10 weeks at a time.

It sounded pretty cool to help people learn how to make websites, so I figured I'd give it a shot.

### The Problem: They Smart, Me Dumb

It turns out that the other instructors all worked as professional programmers who had spent the majority of their time on large production projects.

Because of this, there was a sense that we needed to teach them how to do things "the right way".

Now, I am not a professional programmer so I don't even know what that means sometimes. All I know how to do is to make shit happen. I also spent a lot of time tutoring kids and also teaching my friends how to program.

To put it in another way:

**They were the pros, I'm just an idiot.**

As a result, my personal philosophy differed from theirs significantly.

### My Philosophy

While they were going through an hour-long lecture, I thought to myself, "but if we can get them to feel good *right now*, why shouldn't we? Life's too short not to have fun *right now*."

My whole philosophy is to throw everything out the window and ask: What can we do **right now** to get people's eyes to light up as soon and as frequently as possible? And if it's something that isn't "best practices", well then to hell with "best practices".

To be frank, "best practices" can come later. That'll be the easy part, the hard part is getting them engaged *right now*.

***The most important thing is to make the learners feel like they're doing awesome cool things right away.***

Anything that detracts from that can be saved for later.

## So What Does This All Mean?

That means we're going to solve problems.

Every lesson will have a focus on something cool we want to accomplish. Sometimes it might be something very tiny, but it will nevertheless have a tangible effect. We want to give you the ability to show-off first, the details can come after.
