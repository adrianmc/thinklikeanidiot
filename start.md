  See those mountains in the distance? That's where we're going. Don't worry though, we're going to take it <em>slooowwwww...</em>

## In Short

This site will teach you how to make websites and learn to code by thinking like an idiot (hint, it's me). This is programming for the everyman, the average joe, and the plain jane. If you're in a hurry, feel free to skip this page and go to the [first lesson](/lesson-zero-beginning/). Don't worry, you won't hurt my feelings ... much <i class="fa fa-meh-o"></i>.

## In Long

Yes, I know it's a lame hook, but it got you to read this far. The whole point of thinking like an idiot is so that we don't look at those mountains and feel like giving up. Let's be incredibly short-sighted and just focus on making a tiny step forward and celebrating every inch we make in the right direction.

According to [Kathy Sierra](http://amzn.com/1491919019?tag=thinklikeanidiot-20), to get people engaged and learning quickly, we want to make sure that you are accomplishing *badass* things as soon and as frequently as possible. That's the model we're going with here.
